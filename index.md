## Welcome
Welcome to the Official OWASP Chapter for Islamabad, Pakistan. Pakistan

We are a coalition of developers, security professionals, students, and technology leaders united by a common mission: to make application security visible and integral to the software ecosystem of Islamabad and beyond. As the nation's digital capital, Islamabad drives innovation; our purpose is to ensure that innovation is secure by design.

Our Mission:
To foster a collaborative, open-source community in Islamabad that empowers individuals and organizations to build, procure, and maintain trustworthy software. We provide a neutral forum for education, cutting-edge research, and the free exchange of ideas to tackle the most critical application security challenges facing our region.

What We Do:
• Host meetings & workshops featuring local and international experts.
• Facilitate hands-on training on OWASP projects (like the Top 10, ZAP, ASVS, and Cheat Sheets).
• Build bridges between academia, industry, and government to advance cybersecurity practices.
• Promote a "shift-left" security culture among developers and startups in Pakistan's Silicon Valley.

Join us to learn, share, and contribute. Whether you're a seasoned AppSec professional or just beginning your security journey, you have a place here. Together, we can harden the code that powers our future.

Connect. Learn. Secure.
